Changes since the presentation:

The refresh button works in that things will be sent to the server and then
pulled back and be displayed in a local newsfeed.

Also, hibernate bugs are fixed and everything is full circle.  Media and user
IDs contained in MontageServer.java will be serialized to the database and
pulled up again upon start up of the server.
